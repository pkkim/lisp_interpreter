List:
- cons, car, cdr, list: These can just be treated as normal functions during
  parsing, then treated specially during evaluation: in other words necessary
  built-ins, not keywords.
- `list`
- '(..)
cons, car, cdr
Way to get the arguments to a function as a list?

Add on later:
- string manipulation
- call python functions
- manipulate python objects?

- Lexer
- Parser
- Evaluator

REPL:
- take input -> lexer -> parser -> evaluator -> printer (adds stuff to the persistent environment)

(lambda (x) ((def x 5); x))(6) -> 5
